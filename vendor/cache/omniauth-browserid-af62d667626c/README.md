# OmniAuth BrowserID

Mozilla [Persona](https://login.persona.org/), formerly known as BrowserID, is a great implementation of verified email that lets you quickly and easily login to websites. This is an OmniAuth strategy that allows you to use Persona in your application!

## Installation

    gem install omniauth-browserid

## Usage

Persona works using a Javascript-driven popup window. As such, there is a little more work than usual to integrate it seamlessly into your app. That being said, a default implementation of Persona will work as outlined below.

### Basic Case

To use the built-in form in order to authenticate with Persona, you simply need to add the strategy to your application:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :browser_id
end
```

Now all you need to do is redirect your users to `/auth/browser_id` and you're all set!

### Better Integration

To better integrate Persona with your application, you will want to use the Persona javascript directly in your app. Assuming you included the middleware as described above, here is a way you could structure your HTML:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form id='browser_id_form' action='/auth/browser_id/callback'>
      <input type='hidden' name='assertion'/>
      <button type='submit'>Login with Persona</button>
    </form>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="https://login.persona.org/include.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type='text/javascript'>
      function loginViaEmail() {
        navigator.id.get(function(assertion) {
          if (assertion) {
            $('input[name=assertion]').val(assertion);
            $('#browser_id_form').submit();
          } else {
            window.location = "#{failure_path}"
          }
        });  
      }

      $(function() {
        $('#browser_id_form button').click(function() {
          loginViaEmail();
          return false;
        });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

What this does is sets up a form with a "Login with Persona" button. When the button of the form is clicked, it is intercepted by jQuery and the Persona flow is started. Persona returns an `assertion` that is then used to verify an email. In this example, the form points to `/auth/browser_id/callback` which will automatically perform verification as well as return a standard OmniAuth hash.

## Options

These are the options you can specify that are relevant to Omniauth BrowserID:

* `:verify_url` - The verifier URL (defaults to `https://verifier.login.persona.org/verify`)
* `:name` - The URL at which the strategy will be available (defaults to `browser_id`)
* `:audience_url` - The host of your site. Defaults to the `full_host` of OmniAuth (either automatically determined or determined by the `OmniAuth.config.full_host` option)
